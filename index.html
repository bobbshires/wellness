  <h1>The Ultimate Staircase Workout For Serious Fitness Gains</h1>
<div class="featureimg"><img src="/images/staircase-workout.jpg" width="550" height="230" /></div>
<blockquote>
<p>We're not talking about StairMaster workouts, though they might have their place. We're talking about a good old-fashioned set of steps, be they the zigzagging flights in your office building or the well-trod bleachers at a nearby stadium. A staircase workout is an incredibly effective way to improve fitness and overall health: One study found that simply walking up 200 steps twice a day, five days a week, for eight weeks, can cause a 17 percent increase in VO<sub>2</sub> max, which is a common way of measuring someone's aerobic fitness.</p>
<p>Running up stairs brings even more benefits. Because the body is constantly being lifted upward with each step, it engages more leg muscles than running and improves vertical jump. Plus, according to Greatist Expert and strength trainer Jordan Syatt, running up stairs is easier on the joints than regular sprints, and better improves an athlete's range of motion. </p>
<p>But the best thing about staircase workouts? They can be done on any staircase and they don't cost a thing. So find some steps and step on the gas, because <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/03/staircase-workout_n_4859828.html" target="_blank">Jordan Syatt has put together two incredible high-intensity interval training staircase workouts</a> -- one for beginners and one for the more advanced peeps. You shouldn't need too many stairs for this, just enough that you can run continuously for 10 to 15 seconds (about two to three flights). Remember to keep your focus on the top of the steps ahead of you. You can do it!</p>

<h1>Moderate exercise not only treats, but prevents depression</h1>
    <p class="byline">Posted on October 25, 2013</p>

    <p>TORONTO, ON &ndash; Physical activity is being increasingly recognized as an effective tool to treat depression. PhD candidate George Mammen's review published in the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379713004510">October issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine</a> has taken the connection one step further, finding that moderate exercise can actually prevent episodes of depression in the long term. </p>
    <p>This is the first longitudinal review to focus exclusively on the role that exercise plays in maintaining good mental health and preventing the onset of depression later in life. </p>
    <p>Mammen&mdash;who is supervised by Professor <a href="http://www.physical.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/Meet_the_Faculty/Faulkner.aspx">Guy Faulkner</a>, a co-author of the review&mdash; analyzed over 26 years' worth of research findings to discover that even low levels of physical activity (walking and gardening for 20-30 minutes a day) can ward off depression in people of all age groups. </p>
    <p>Mammen's findings come at a time when mental health experts want to expand their approach beyond treating depression with costly prescription medication. &quot;We need a prevention strategy now more than ever,&quot; he says. &quot;Our health system is taxed. We need to shift focus and look for ways to fend off depression from the start.&quot;</p>
    <p>Mammen acknowledges that other factors influence a person's likelihood of experiencing depression, including their genetic makeup. But he says that the scope of research he assessed demonstrates that regardless of individual predispositions, there's a clear take-away for everyone. &quot;It's definitely worth taking note that if you're currently active, you should sustain it.  If you&rsquo;re not physically active, you should initiate the habit. This review shows promising evidence that the impact of being active goes far beyond the physical.&quot;
    <h1>Study: 10% of teens in the ER abuse prescription drugs</h1>

    <p><strong><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/30/10-percent-of-teensabusepainkillersandsedativesstudysays.html">A University of Michigan study found that one in 10 teens treated in the ER had abused painkillers and sedatives</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Approximately one in 10 young teenagers receiving emergency medical treatment admitted to abusing prescription painkillers and sedatives like Oxycontin and Valium within the last year, according to new research from the University of Michigan released this week. The findings come just two months after a study in the journal The Lancet declared painkiller addictions the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history.</p>
    <p>In a survey of more than 2,100 teenagers between the ages of 14 and 20 years old who visited the emergency room at the University of Michigan Medical Center, 10.4 percent admitted to having abused prescription painkillers or sedatives within the last year &mdash; and most didn't have any prescriptions for the drugs on their medical records, the researchers said.</p>
    <p>Among the 8.7 percent of teens who reported abusing a prescription opioid like Oxycontin, methadone or hydrocodone, only about 15 percent had a prescription for the painkillers; among the 5.4 percent of teenagers who admitted to abusing a sedative like Ativan, Xanax or Valium just 12 percent had a prescription.</p>
